The table is always laid with a crisp starched antique table cloth usually with an embroidered decoration picked to match the season or the occasion. There’s polished antique silver wear and the daintiest napkins you’ve ever seen! She has cake forks for afternoon tea and coffee spoons kept in leather boxes with silk linings. \nWhen we visit for lunch it’s often a roasted joint with side salads and my uncle Wudy will bring it to the table to carve and our plates will be passed around to receive our portion. There’s ALWAYS trifle for dessert when there’s guests (my mums secret recipe) and to finish the meal, tea or coffee. Freshly made and placed in the centre of the table to brew while tea cups and saucers are laid out and milk and cream passed around in matching little jugs. \nHonestly it’s a beautiful thing to behold and every time we visit I come away promising myself that I’ll bring a little of Aunty Hazel’s ceremony into my everyday meals......Wouldn’t you love to be the girl who has the right fork for the right piece of cake and always, ALWAYS puts a crisp napkin on her lap to eat her meal? No? Just me? 😂😂 We’re kicking off my February challenge group today and this month is all about using rituals in our everyday life to make it something beautiful. You see I didn’t get into this coaching gig to stand at the sidelines with a virtual megaphone barking ‘jump!’ at my challengers all day. Nope, I’m not that coach. \nIn The House of Why groups we’re looking at your whole lifestyle. We’re making self care, exercise, nutrition and general wellness into something so beautiful that’s it’s a total joy to fit in to your day...every day....forever! And that means so much more than just squeezing in a 30min workout and eating salad as much as we can. If you want my help getting started on making your beautiful lifestyle, it’s not too late to join, you know where I am 😘😘' for this Instagram image.
